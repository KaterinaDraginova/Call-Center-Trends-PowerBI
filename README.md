# Task
Create a Power BI dashboard to help the Call Centre Manager track key performance metrics and short-term behavioural trends, supporting clearer, data-driven decisions.

The dashboard should show answered vs. abandoned calls, speed of answer, call duration, and how customer satisfaction is trending over time. It should also surface any patterns in customer or agent behaviour that may signal issues or areas for improvement.

The design must be intuitive, visually clear, and ready for management discussions, with a strong focus on highlighting trends and insights in a clean, presentation-friendly format.

# Process
In Power BI Editor, I performed the following data transformation steps:
promoted headers, changed the data types of relevant columns to their appropriate types (e.g., date, time, text, etc.) to enable accurate calculations and avoid errors. Also calculated call duration in seconds by:
1. Duplicatingthe time column (representing call duration).
2. Then converted the duplicated column to the Duration data type.
3. Next, I added a custom column using the formula:
Duration.TotalSeconds([DuplicatedColumn] - #time(0, 0, 0)).  

This formula calculates the total duration of each call in seconds by subtracting midnight (#time(0,0,0)) from the call time and converting the result to seconds.

# Analyze

I have created measures to answer the questions and provide the following KPIs. Here are some of them:  
<br><br>

- ### Positive Satisfaction Rating

<br><br>

- ### After getting all the required measures, I added cards in my dashboard to show all the KPIs at the top.

<br><br>

- ### Average Talk Duration  
  Next, I created a bar chart to show the average talk duration of agents. Jim has the longest talk duration and Becky is the fastest.

<br><br>

- ### Resolved Calls Per Day  
  Then, I created a column chart that shows total resolved calls per day of the week. It shows that every Monday and Saturday, agents have higher resolved calls than the rest of the week.

<br><br>

- ### Agent Stats Table  
  To summarize all the stats of the agents, I inserted a table that shows their total calls, answered calls, abandoned calls, resolved calls, unresolved calls, and satisfaction ratings.

- ### Call Topics Treemap  
  The last visualization is a treemap showing all the call topics.

<br><br>

- ### Final Dashboard  
  Finally, I designed the dashboard and created the background.
